LICQ Qt-GUI Plugin v1.0

A plugin for Licq to enable a gui based on Qt.

LICENSE

This program is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL, with the
exception that it may be compiled and linked with the TrollTech QT
library without implying that any of the rights or restrictions
associated with the GPL are applied to the QT library.

INSTALLATION:


0. Make sure you unpacked the source into the plugins directory of
   the licq source tree.
1. Type './configure' and it will determine all the right settings and 
   directories for your system.  If it fails, try the following manual 
   directory specifications:
  --with-kde              To enable various KDE options (including kstyles)
  --x-includes=DIR        X include files are in DIR
  --x-libraries=DIR       X library files are in DIR
  --with-qt-dir           where the root of qt is installed
  --with-qt-includes      where the qt includes are.
  --with-qt-libraries     where the qt library is installed.
2. Have a look at config.h and see if you want to change any of the
   options in it.
3. Type 'make' and in theory it will build. If you are using a non-GNU system,
   such as FreeBSD or Solaris, you will need the GNU version of make, often
   installed as `gmake'.  If you get errors about "void *" see the FAQ.
4. Type 'make install' and licq will be installed (defaults to 
   /usr/local).

Licq Qt-GUI requires the following:
Qt >= 2.1 (if you are using rpm then it requires the qt and qt-devel rpm)
Some C++ compiler
KDE >= 2.0 (CVS) for KDE support

* * * IF YOU USE Qt-1.x PROGRAMS (like KDE), READ THIS! * * *
If you get errors about unknown symbols in the qt-gui plugin library,
make sure you're using the Qt-2 moc program and that you're linking
to libqt.so.2.
1. At the shell you're invoking "configure" for the plugin type
   > echo $QTDIR
   You should see the path to Qt-2 (probably /usr/lib/qt-2.0.x, depending
   on the version you're using).
   a) If you don't, and you _have_ Qt-2 binary and headers (qt and qt-devel
      for RedHat users) installed for sure, issue the following command:
      > ls /usr/lib/qt-2*/lib/libqt.so.2
   b) If ls didn't print any line, try substituting /usr/lib with
      /usr/local/lib, so that the command looks like:
      > ls /usr/local/lib/qt-2*/lib/libqt.so.2
   c) if you see a file name printed in either step a) or b), cut the
      /lib/libqt.so.2 off its end and set QTDIR to the remainder, e.g.
      if you see "/usr/lib/qt-2.0.2/lib/libqt.so.2", type
      > export QTDIR="/usr/lib/qt-2.0.2"
      If you use csh or a compatible shell, type
      > setenv QTDIR "/usr/lib/qt-2.0.2"
      instead.

2. Compile the plugin
   Refer to the instructions under INSTALLATION (above)


CONFIGURATION:

Configuration is done through the ~/.licq/licq_qt-gui.conf file, which 
contains .ini style options.  Help on each option is include in the file.  

USE:

Type licq -h -p qt-gui for commandline help.

Using licq is very straight-forward.  To access any of the options, just 
right click on a user and select the relevant command, or double click on 
the user.  A window will open containing a tab dialog with all the 
possible things to do.  In this way you can read a new message, check user 
info, and send a message all from the same window at the same time.  
One key feature of licq is the network status window, which can be viewed 
by selecting "Show Network Window" under the "System" menu.  This screen 
will show you exactly what is occuring at the protocol level.  
The menu option "<your alias>" will allow you to view your own settings 
and to check system messages.


PROBLEMS:
