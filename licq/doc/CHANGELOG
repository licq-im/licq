   boxes.  Shows more information on each user in the window now.
   Status bar added, showing on/offline status, number of system 
   messages, and number of new messages.
o  Mini mode where Licq takes up much less screen real-estate.
o  Search User function added.  Search by first name, last name
   email address, or alias.
o  Send URL works.


New in v0.34

o  Word wrap works in read messages properly (wraps words instead of
   cutting them off)
o  Authorization has been added.  Now when users ask for authorization
   you see more of their information and the request.  And you can
   authorize users to add you with "Users" "Authorize User" menu
   option.
o  Fixed the vertical bars error in windows boxes.  Now Licq sends
   messages in DOS style (carriage return / newline) instead of UNIX
   style (newline only).
o  Icon added, thanks to Dave and the Gimp.
o  Docking now supported in WindowMaker, BlackBox...
o  Sound support added.  Currently only one sound which plays on
   incoming messages.


New in v0.33

o  Command-line options now work.  Try -d to dump some status debugging
   info and -b to set base directory (defaults to ~/.licq) and -h for
   help.
o  Word wrap works in the send message dialog!   Borrowed some code from
   KEdit and now it works.  Wrote some code to get it to work in other
   dialogs (such as read msg).  It's not perfect, but a patch will be
   released soon to fix it.
o  Licq no longer crashes if you aren't connected.  It runs fine and will
   simply give an error when you try and connect.
o  Major memory leak fixed, should make Licq more stable.
o  Foundation for multiple server support added.  
o  Licq now retries a set number of times before giving up on mirabilis 
   instead of stopping right away.
o  Fixed the annoying "Hide" button on the wrong side problem.  Now 
   everything is more standard and the window won't dissappear when you
   hit "enter".
o  Autoconf configuration thanks to Nic Bellamy.  Now you can just
   type configure to get everything working.
o  Rewrite of javaToLicq, making it much much better.  Thanks again
   to Nic Bellamy.
o  Restructure of directory structure again.  Now licq is installed
   in /usr/local/share/licq, but each user *has* to install it into
   their own ~/.licq directory.  Licq.inst has been rewriten to better
   accomodate this.


New in v0.32

o  Option to dump the network window output to a file to aid in deubugging.  
   Check box on the window itself toggles writting to BASE_DIR/netwin.debug
o  The network window now adds lines at the top instead of at the bottom, 
   making it much easier to keep track of what's going on.  No more jumping 
   all over the place to keep track of the most recent event. 
o  Licq now saves the size of the window and its position when it exits, and 
   restores it when you restart.  The information is stored in 
   conf/geometry.conf
o  Added users are automatically saved to disk.
o  New users (either added manually or automatically) are automatically updated 
   if you are online and their info saved.
o  Double clicking on a user with no new message now brings up the send message 
   tab instead of the read message one.
o  History is now editable and you can save changes to disk.
o  Remove user now works, including removing the config and history files.
o  Selecting a function for a user when the function window is already open now 
   updates the function window instead of doing nothing.
o  javaToLicq and micqToLicq scripts have been updated to actually work.
o  Major reimplementation of the directory code.  Now Licq installs to 
   /usr/local/licq (you can change this, but I don't recommend it) and will 
   default read the config data from here.  But you can specify a different 
   BASE_DIR on the command line to give each user a seperate configuration.
   For example, running "licq" will start up licq using /usr/local/licq as the 
   BASE_DIR and running "licq ~/.licq" will start licq using ~/.licq as the 
   BASE_DIR.  I recommend putting the later as an alias and using it.
o  New users are now marked in a different color until you open the function window
   for them.  This allows you to tell how is new and who isn't.  
o  Licq can now detect if a packet has come from another Licq client and will
   indicate this and the version number on the network window for each incoming tcp 
   packet.
